# Simex
 R functions to implement the SIMEX estimation for the iAR model. The results obtained with these functions are presented in the paper "Novel SIMEX algorithm for autoregressive models to a better estimation of AGN variability", published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS), Volume 540, Issue 1, June 2025, Pages 521â€“531. https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staf764

This repository includes the R functions and an R Markdown example using simulated data.
